                        Bonnie's Dog and Cat Grooming has been a fixture on Capitol Hill since 1997. The salon has a staff of experienced professionals, several who have worked there for more than 15 years. "Bonnie Peregoy and her staff win high marks for their gentle touch with even the most skittish dogs" (Washington Post). Click here to read the article.(Opens in a new window.)

                        Bonnie Peregoy "went to the dogs" in 1973 when she bought her first Afghan Hound. She then apprenticed as a dog groomer and began competing in AKC conformation and obedience events. Over the years Bonnie has owned two boarding kennels, been a featured speaker at Groom Expo multiple times, served as president of two AKC kennel clubs, won the Dog Writers of America Maxwell Award (1993), was a staff member of Camp Gone to the Dogs for 27 years and bred multiple champions and obedience titlists. Bonnie has produced a series of training videos, featuring positive reinforcement behavior shaping, through her company:

                        Bonnie says: "My business is dedicated to the customers who through the years have entrusted me with their best friends, dropping their precious pets off at my door and trusting me to handle them with care and concern; to the wonderful dogs and cats who have passed through those doors and have patiently waited for me to learn their language, so I could listen to them. And to my own dogs, who have kept me company on this journey and taught me that language."
